# Using the `active` exact at `/`

- Docs on [`Navlink`](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/components/nav-link)
  If the end prop is used, it will ensure this component isn't matched as "active" when its descendant paths are matched. For example, to render a link that is only active at the website root and not any other URLs, you can use `end`:

```tsx
<NavLink to="/" title="Timer" end>
  <Timer size={24} />
</NavLink>
```
